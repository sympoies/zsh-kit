# zsh-kit

A modular, self-contained Zsh environment focused on manual control, clean structure, and script-based extensibility,
with emoji-powered UX and built-in Git tools.

## ✨ Core Features

> This Zsh environment provides a clean structure and several built-in tools.

- 🌟 [Login banner](docs/guides/login-banner.md): Emoji-powered shell intro with rotating quotes
- 🧩 [Plugin System](docs/guides/plugin-system.md): Git-powered declarative loader with auto-clone and update support
- ⏳ [Progress bar utilities](docs/guides/progress-bar.md): TTY-friendly progress output for long-running commands
- 🚀 [Starship](https://starship.rs): Customized prompt with language & context awareness
- 🧭 [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide): Smart directory jumping, aliased as `z`
- 🔧 Modular and lazy-friendly structure under `scripts/`
- 🧹 Centralized `cache/` and `.private/` folders for clean separation of history, state, and secrets

## Setup

This repo is designed to be used as your Zsh config directory via `ZDOTDIR`.

### Runtime Setup With `zsh-kit`

The repository exposes a stable setup hook at
`bootstrap/zsh-kit-setup.zsh`. The nils-cli `zsh-kit` binary clones or updates
the repository, validates this hook, and dispatches the repo-owned setup
behavior:

```bash
zsh-kit setup --repo git@github.com:graysurf/zsh-kit.git --dry-run
zsh-kit setup --repo git@github.com:graysurf/zsh-kit.git --apply --install-tools skip
```

Forward optional feature flags with `--features`:

```bash
zsh-kit setup --repo git@github.com:graysurf/zsh-kit.git --apply --features docker,opencode
```

Tool installation is explicit. `--install-tools skip` performs no package
installation. `--install-tools repo` delegates to this repository's
`install-tools.zsh`; direct hook dry-runs use the installer's `--dry-run` mode.

For repository-local validation, the hook can be run without private mutations:

```bash
bootstrap/zsh-kit-setup.zsh --features docker --install-tools skip --dry-run --smoke
```

In your `~/.zshenv`, set the custom config location **and explicitly source** this repo’s `.zshenv`:

```bash
export ZDOTDIR="$HOME/.config/zsh"
if [[ -r "$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv" ]]; then
  source "$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv"
fi
```

### Optional Features (`ZSH_FEATURES`)

Some modules are disabled by default (not sourced; no wrappers generated).
Enable them by setting `ZSH_FEATURES` in your **home** `~/.zshenv` **before** sourcing this repo:

```bash
export ZSH_FEATURES="docker,opencode"
```

Current features:

- `opencode`: enables `opencode-tools` (plus `opencode-tools` completion)
- `docker`: enables `docker-tools` + `docker-aliases` (plus `docker-tools` + `docker` completion)

Why the extra `source`? `.zshenv` is the first startup file, so setting `ZDOTDIR` inside `~/.zshenv`
does not automatically make Zsh restart and load `$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv`.

Zsh will now load:

- `$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv` for all shells
- `$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile` for login shells
- `$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc` for interactive shells

For more details, see: [docs/guides/startup-files.md](docs/guides/startup-files.md).

Make sure that `.zshrc` sources the bootstrap loader:

```bash
source "$ZDOTDIR/bootstrap/bootstrap.zsh"
```

This will initialize all scripts in proper order via the `load_script_group_ordered()` / `load_script_group()` loader helpers.

> 🧰 This setup expects you to have your favorite CLI tools installed.  
> It won't hand-hold you, and assumes tools like `eza`, `tree`, `bat`, or `fzf` are already available.  
> If something errors out, you're probably just missing a binary — install and carry on.  

## Philosophy

No magic. Fully reproducible.  
Modular by design, manual by default.

## 🧑‍💻 Why I Made This

This setup is the result of many hours spent refining my shell environment.  
It includes several tools I built myself—some small, some extensive.  
Among them, [git-magic](scripts/git/git-magic.zsh) remains my favorite and most-used.  

If there’s something you use every day, it’s worth taking the time to make it yours.
