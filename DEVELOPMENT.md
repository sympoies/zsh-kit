# Development Guide

This repository is a modular Zsh environment. This document describes the development
conventions and verification workflow for the first-party code in this repo.

## Scope

This repo contains:

- First-party Zsh config and tooling: `.zshrc`, `.zprofile`, `bootstrap/`, `scripts/`, `tools/`
- Vendored third-party plugins: `plugins/` (follow upstream conventions; do not restyle)
- Non-Zsh scripts (`bash`/`sh`/`awk`/etc.): follow the best practices of their target language/shell

Unless stated otherwise, the rules below apply only to first-party Zsh code.

## Where to start

- `scripts/**`: see `scripts/README.md`
- `scripts/_completion/_*`: see `scripts/_completion/README.md`

## Python tooling

- Python virtualenvs are managed by `uv`.
- Create or refresh the repo environment with `uv sync --locked`.
- Run Python-backed tools through repo scripts or `uv run --locked <command>`.
- Semgrep is tracked in the `dev` dependency group and installed into `.venv` by `uv sync`.
  The semgrep runner uses `uv run --locked --only-group dev semgrep`.

## First-party Zsh baselines

- Target shell: first-party shell code supports **Zsh only**.
- Shebang (executable Zsh scripts): use `#!/usr/bin/env -S zsh -f`.
  - Library files that are only `source`d typically do not need a shebang.
- Function isolation: start functions with `emulate -L zsh` and explicitly manage options via
  `setopt` / `unsetopt`.
- I/O:
  - Do not use `echo`.
  - Use `print -r --` for stdout and `print -u2 -r --` for stderr.
  - Use `printf` for snippets that may run under `sh`/`bash` (e.g., subshells, `xargs`, `sh -c`).
- Option parsing: prefer `zparseopts` (Zsh) over GNU `getopt`.

## Verification

### Quick checks

- Single file syntax check: `zsh -n -- path/to/file.zsh`
- Repo-wide check (recommended): `./tools/check.zsh` (includes fzf-def docblock audit)
- Test suite: `./tests/run.zsh`

### Additional checks

- Docblock audit (fzf-def; missing docblocks are failures): `./tools/audit-fzf-def-docblocks.zsh --check`
- Markdown lint audit: `bash ./scripts/ci/markdownlint-audit.sh --strict` (uses `rumdl`)
- Smoke load (isolated ZDOTDIR/cache; any stderr is a failure): `./tools/check.zsh --smoke`
- Bash scripts (only when touching `#!/bin/bash` files; runs ShellCheck if installed): `./tools/check.zsh --bash`
- Semgrep scan (bash/zsh; JSON output under `out/semgrep/`): `./tools/check.zsh --semgrep`
- Everything: `./tools/check.zsh --all`

## Local git hooks

Local hooks are managed by [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) via the
tracked `lefthook.yml`:

- Install the runner once: `brew install lefthook`
- Wire hooks into this clone: `lefthook install`

What runs:

- `pre-commit`: fast staged-file checks — whitespace, `zsh -n` syntax on staged `*.zsh`
  (excluding `plugins/`), the typeset gates, and the markdown lint audit.
- `pre-push`: signed-commit guard (`scripts/ci/verify-signed-commits.sh`), `./tools/check.zsh`,
  `./tools/check-completions.zsh`, and `./tests/run.zsh`.

Heavier checks (smoke load, env bool audit, semgrep) are not gated locally; CI
(`.github/workflows/check.yml`) remains the authoritative enforcement point because local
hooks can be bypassed (`--no-verify`, `LEFTHOOK=0`) or left uninstalled. Run a hook
manually with `lefthook run pre-commit --all-files` or `lefthook run pre-push --all-files`
(without `--all-files`, manual runs have no staged/push file list and the jobs skip).

## Suggested workflow

- After any code change: run `./tools/check.zsh`.
- `./tools/check.zsh` includes the fzf-def docblock audit; run `./tools/audit-fzf-def-docblocks.zsh --check`
  directly only when you want the standalone report.
- If you changed bootstrap/startup/plugin loading: also run `./tools/check.zsh --smoke`.
- If you added a new feature: add/update a smoke test under `tests/` (fast, deterministic) and run
  `./tests/run.zsh`.
- If you changed any `#!/bin/bash` scripts: also run `./tools/check.zsh --bash`.
- For PRs and change reviews: record each relevant check as `pass`, `failed`, or `not run` (with a short reason).
